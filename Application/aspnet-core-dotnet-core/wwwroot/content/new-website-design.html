    <h1>New Website Design</h1>
    <p>I'm in the process of porting my site to ASP.NET Razor Pages using .NET 7.0, hosted on Azure. I'm still very early in the 
    process, so it's quite rough around the edges, but it's already much easier to use that my old host on WordPress.</p>

    <p>I like to write posts where I play with different scripts and CSS, and that's not easy to do on WordPress. Yes, it's 
    possible, but it's a pain to maintain. What I've always wanted to do is just write plain HTML pages with custom CSS and script 
    inline, so I've finally designed something that will let me do that. For example, the content of this page is coming from 
    <a href="/content/new-website-design.html">a plain HTML file stored on the file system</a>. When I want to serve it though 
    the standard site layout, I pull out the body and any other bits I need from the header and add those to the layout. It is 
    SO much nicer to write and edit content now!</p>

    <p>I have a lot of content that I still need to port over from my old site, but fortunately I have some help in this regard. 
    WordPress exposes an API that I can use to pull in pages and posts, so I wrote a Razor Page that uses that API so that I 
    can pull the old content as save it as HTML files in my new repository.</p>

    <p>Once I get things cleaned up a bit I'll post another article explaining how the new system works, and I'll also share 
    the GitHub repository where I keep the site code.</p>

    <p>Please <a href="mailto:paul@smartsam.com">let me know</a> if you encounter any errors or other problems.</p>
