    <h1>Set-Associative Cache in C#, Part 2: Interface Design</h1>

    <p>This is part 2 of a three-part series on implementing a set-associative cache in C#. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/page/set-associative-cache-in-c-part-1-analysis-initial-design/" target="_blank">part 1</a>, we looked at how set-associative caches work and sketched out the basic design. In this part, we’ll expand on the design a bit more and define a code interface for the cache. In part 3, we’ll turn the design into working code.</p>

    <h2>Interface</h2>

    <p>Now that we have the overall design, it&#8217;s time to consider what interface to provide for users of the cache. Let&#8217;s consider the methods and properties that a cache type might provide.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Methods
            <ul>
                <li>Store items in the cache</li>
                <li>Retrieve items from the cache</li>
                <li>Query for the presence of an item by key</li>
                <li>Remove items from the cache</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Properties
            <ul>
                <li>Count of items in the cache</li>
                <li>Capacity of the cache</li>
                <li><span style="color: initial;">Number of sets in the cache</span></li>
                <li>Number of items (ways) in each set</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The cache should also provide the means to enumerate over cache items, as well as enumerate keys and value independently. In other words, it should function like an standard <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic?view=net-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.NET generic collection</a>. That means we should implement the interfaces that will allow the cache to work with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.icollection-1?view=net-5.0#extension-methods" target="_blank">several extension methods</a> as well as standard enumeration patterns like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements#the-foreach-statement" target="_blank">foreach</a>. Generic collections in the .NET library implement the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.icollection-1?view=net-5.0" target="_blank"><em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em></a> interface, and that interface is derived from <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1?view=net-5.0" target="_blank">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</a></em> and <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable?view=net-5.0" target="_blank">IEnumerable</a></em>. If we derive our cache interface from <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em>, we&#8217;ll get a few of the methods and properties that we need, and we&#8217;ll be prepared to interoperate with existing .NET code that uses the <em>ICollection</em>, <em>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</em>, and <em>IEnumerable</em> interfaces.</p>

    <p>Following is the <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em> interface and the two interfaces it derives from, <em>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</em> and <em>IEnumerable</em>:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">namespace System.Collections {
    // Exposes an enumerator, which supports a simple iteration over a non-generic collection.
    public interface IEnumerable {
        // Returns an enumerator that iterates through a collection.
        IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
    }
}

namespace System.Collections.Generic {
    // Exposes the enumerator, which supports a simple iteration over a collection of a specified type.
    public interface IEnumerable&lt;out T&gt; : IEnumerable {
        // Returns an enumerator that iterates through the collection.
        new IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();
    }

    // Defines methods to manipulate generic collections.
    public interface ICollection&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, IEnumerable {
        // Gets the number of elements contained in the collection.
        int Count {
            get;
        }

        // Gets a value indicating whether the collection is read-only.
        bool IsReadOnly {
            get;
        }

        // Adds an item to the collection.
        void Add(T item);

        // Removes all items from the collection.
        void Clear();

        // Determines whether the collection contains a specific value.
        bool Contains(T item);

        // Copies the elements of the collection to an array, starting at a particular array index.
        void CopyTo(T[] array, int arrayIndex);

        // Removes the first occurrence of a specific object from the System.Collections.Generic.ICollection`1.
        bool Remove(T item);
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>We could derive our cache interface directly from <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em>, since it provides several of the methods and properties in the list above. That&#8217;s definitely something we want for interoperability, but the problem for day-to-day users is that the methods accept a single generic object type, and our cache is designed to function as a dictionary, which uses keys to store and retrieve values. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.parkscomputing.com/2021/08/set-associative-cache-in-c-part-1-analysis-initial-design/" target="_blank">part 1</a>, we considered using a <em>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</em> type to store the cache data. Let&#8217;s look at how adding a cache item would work in practice using the <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em> interface:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">// We have to create a new KeyValuePair for every method call.
coupleCache.Add(new KeyValuePair("Brad", "Angelina"));

// Maybe we could minimize the constructor...
coupleCache.Add(new("Brad", "Angelina"));</code></pre>

    <p>It works, but it&#8217;s clunky. As for <em>Contains</em> and <em>Remove</em>, those are effectively useless because we would either have to know the value of the cache item in order to use those methods (which defeats the entire purpose of the cache), or we would have to specify that those methods would ignore the value. Neither approach is workable.</p>

    <p>In part 1, we noted that the cache works a lot like the .NET <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?view=net-5.0" target="_blank">generic <em>Dictionary</em> type</a>. That collection implements the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?view=net-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>IDictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</em></a> interface:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">namespace System.Collections.Generic {
    // Represents a generic collection of key/value pairs.
    public interface IDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; : ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt;,
                                                 IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt;,
                                                 IEnumerable
    {
        // Gets or sets the element with the specified key.
        TValue this[TKey key] {
            get;
            set;
        }

        // Gets an ICollection containing the keys of the IDictionary.
        ICollection&lt;TKey&gt; Keys {
            get;
        }

        // Gets an ICollection containing the values in the IDictionary.
        ICollection&lt;TValue&gt; Values {
            get;
        }

        // Adds an element with the provided key and value to the IDictionary.
        void Add(TKey key, TValue value);

        // Determines whether the IDictionary contains an element with the specified key.
        bool ContainsKey(TKey key);

        // Removes the element with the specified key from the System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2.
        bool Remove(TKey key);

        // Gets the value associated with the specified key.
        bool TryGetValue(TKey key, [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out TValue value);
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>That looks like exactly what we need. It gives us a method to add an item with the key and value in separate parameters, a method to check for the presence of an item by key, a method to remove an item by key, and a method to retrieve an item&#8217;s value by key. </p>

    <p>There are two other advantages to using this interface as the basis of our cache. First, it&#8217;s a standard interface that would be familiar to experienced .NET developers. Second, it would interoperate with standard .NET libraries, idioms, and extension methods. On the strength of these advantages, we&#8217;ll derive our cache interface from <em>IDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em> (and, by extension, from <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em>, <em>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</em>, and <em>IEnumerable</em> as well).</p>

    <p>The remaining properties that aren&#8217;t provided by <em>IDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em> are the capacity, the number of sets, and the number of ways. We&#8217;ll add these to our cache interface. </p>

    <p>There is also one other method that might be useful. Remember that when we add a new cache item, it might evict an existing cache item. Most of the time it won&#8217;t matter what item gets evicted, but there may be scenarios in which we would want to know which item would be evicted if a new cache item were added. To that end, we&#8217;ll add a method to support such a scenario and call it <em>TryGetEvictKey</em>, following the pattern of <em>TryGetValue</em>. </p>

    <p>Now we can finally define our cache interface, <em>ISetAssociativeCache&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em>.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ParksComputing.SetAssociativeCache {
    // Represents a generic set-associative cache of key/value pairs.
    public interface ISetAssociativeCache&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; : IDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; {
        // Gets the capacity of the cache.
        int Capacity { get; }

        // Gets the number of sets in the cache.
        int Sets { get; }

        // Gets the capacity in each set.
        int Ways { get; }

        // If the given key would cause an existing cache item to be evicted, returns true and sets
        // evictKey to the key of the cache item that would be evicted if the new key were added.
        bool TryGetEvictKey(TKey key, out TKey evictKey);
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>This interface will be implemented by concrete classes which provide the behavior of the set-associative cache. </p>

    <h2>Implementing Cache-Eviction Policies</h2>

    <p>We discussed in part 1 how cache items are evicted when a new cache item is added to a set which is already full, and there are several policies that can be implemented, depending on the specific use case for the cache. So far we have not addressed how those policies will be provided or implemented. </p>

    <p>One method that I played with early on was inspired by Andrei Alexandrescu&#8217;s C++ policy-based design as described in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_C%2B%2B_Design" target="_blank">Modern C++ Design</a>. It involved supplying a policy class as a generic parameter to the concrete class that implemented <em>ISetAssociativeCache&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em>. In practice, instantiating a cache instance would look like the following:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">ISetAssociativeCache&lt;string, string&gt; = new SetAssociativeCache&lt;string, string, LruPolicy&gt;(4, 2);</code></pre>

    <p>Implementing it was a fun exercise, but after playing with it a while I realized that it didn&#8217;t really gain me anything. There was no practical difference between the code above and the following code, in terms of what clients had to write:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">ISetAssociativeCache&lt;string, string&gt; = new LruCache&lt;string, string&gt;(4, 2);</code></pre>

    <p>In other words, it made more sense to just put the policy into a concrete class that implemented the cache interface. </p>

    <p>The only other variation I could come up with was the scenario of changing the policy at runtime:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">ICachePolicy lruPolicy = new LruCachePolicy();
ISetAssociativeCache&lt;string, string&gt; cache = new FlexCache&lt;string, string&gt;(4, 2, LruCachePolicy);

// some time later, for some reason...
cache.Policy = new LfuCachePolicy();</code></pre>

    <p>I couldn&#8217;t come up with a specific reason to do this, but I could at least imagine that it could happen in practice. Even so, that is an implementation detail can be left to specific implementations, so the <em>ISetAssociativeCache&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em> interface already provides enough functionality for most mainstream use cases.</p>

    <p>The three policies that I&#8217;ve implemented so far are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)" target="_blank">least-recently used (LRU)</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Most_recently_used_(MRU)" target="_blank">most-recently used (MRU)</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least-frequently_used_(LFU)" target="_blank">least-frequently used (LFU)</a>. All three of them ultimately derive from a common class that implements nearly all of the cache code. </p>

    <p>There are some key differences in behavior between policies based on recency of use (LRU, MRU) and policies based on frequency of use. The xRU policies based on how recently a cache item was stored, updated, or accessed can be managed by sorting the keys in a set so that the most recently stored, updated, or accessed cache item is moved to the lowest index in the set, pushing the least-recently used item to the highest index. No other metadata needs to be stored. For other policies, such as ones based on how frequently a cache item is used, some data to track the implementation of the policy must be provided.</p>

    <p>In order to keep as much common code as possible in a single class, let&#8217;s re-evaluate how the key array is stored. In part 1 we considered this layout:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">int[] keyArray;</code></pre>

    <p>I hinted at the time that we would change this definition, and this is why. We need to provide another bit of data alongside the index into the value array. Let&#8217;s change the definition to the following:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><code class="language-csharp">KeyValuePair&lt;int, int&gt;[] keyArray;</code></pre>

    <p>Even though LRU and MRU policies don&#8217;t use the second <em>int</em>, most other policies will make use of it. LFU will increment it each time a cache item is accessed. Policies based on a cache item&#8217;s age might use the second <em>int</em> to store a date/time stamp.</p>

    <h2>The Class Structure</h2>

    <p>Given that xRU policies and xFU policies diverge on how they track aging of cache items, but otherwise share the vast majority of the rest of their code, we can consider a class structure like the following:</p>

    <div class="wp-block-image">
        <figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/images/set-associative-cache-class-diagram.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="804" height="430" src="/images/set-associative-cache-class-diagram.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1811" srcset="/images/set-associative-cache-class-diagram.jpg 804w, /images/set-associative-cache-class-diagram-300x160.jpg 300w, /images/set-associative-cache-class-diagram-768x411.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></a></figure>
    </div>

    <p>The only class here that we haven&#8217;t discussed is <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ireadonlydictionary-2?view=net-5.0" target="_blank">IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</a></em>. This allows clients to share the cache in a read-only manner, such that clients may access the data in the cache without being able to modify it.</p>

    <h2>Coming Up</h2>

    <p>In the next article, we’ll finally implement the class structure above and try the cache in some sample code.</p>
