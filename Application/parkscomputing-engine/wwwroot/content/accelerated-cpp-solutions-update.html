    <h1>Accelerated C++ Solutions are Back</h1>
    
    <p>Several years ago, I started writing solutions to the exercises in 
    <a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/"><i>Accelerated C++</i></a>, by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo, on my 
    old WordPress site. They got a bit messed up when I changed themes, and I never bothered to update them or continue 
    writing them.</p>

    <p>Now that I have a new web site engine, I can finally start working on them again. You may find the first few 
    chapters on <a href="/accelerated-cpp-solutions">the new start page</a>, or in the 
    navigation bar at the top of this page.</p>
