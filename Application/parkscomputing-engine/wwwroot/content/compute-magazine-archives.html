    <h1><em>COMPUTE!</em> Magazine Archives!</h1>

    <p>I love the Internet! I just found an <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/index/">archive of
            <em>COMPUTE!</em> magazine</a>, which is the magazine that taught me how to program in the 1980's. Just
        recently I was lamenting not keeping every single issue I ever had (which was most of them), but now I can flip
        back through them any time. Looking through the site really brought back some memories of when I first started
        messing with computers, around 1983 or so.</p>

    <p>I would run straight from the mailbox to my <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ti994a.html">TI-99/4A</a> (later, it
        was a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html">Commodore 64</a>) when a new issue of <em>COMPUTE!</em>
        arrived. Each issue had several program listings that readers could type in and run, usually in BASIC. The
        really good games and utilities were in assembly language, but these weren't published as assembly listings.
        They were page after page of BASIC code consisting almost entirely of DATA statements full of numbers that would
        get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE">POKE</a>d into memory by a FOR loop.</p>

    <p>I'd sit and type page after page after page of that, and if I did it right, I could play a game until it was time
        to turn off the computer and do homework. Then, if I wanted to play it again, I'd type all of that in again,
        until I finally put a <a href="http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/hardware/cassette/recorder.html">cassette
            recorder</a> on layaway at Sears so I could store the programs.</p>

    <p>The cassette recorder was pretty entertaining, too. There was a counter that could be used to keep track of where
        each program was on the cassette. I kept a sheet of paper next to the computer filled with tape labels and
        counter positions so I could find all my programs when I needed them. The TI recorder would actually play the
        bits as audio while the program loaded, and after that I could pop in a music cassette and play it through the
        TV speakers. That was way before Winamp.</p>

    <p>Yes, I said "TV." I didn't have a computer monitor until a few years later. My gracious parents, who I suppose
        had decided that I might eventually make a living with computers and move out, would let me monopolize the TV
        for hours at a time while I drew silly pictures on the screen with my computer. I would sketch, for example, the
        USS Enterprise on graph paper, split the graph grid into 8x8 squares, convert each row of each 8x8 grid into a
        hex number, then type those hex numbers into a BASIC program that would draw the picture.</p>

    <p>Mind you, this was <em>the</em> family TV, back before there were TVs in every room. It sat on a low table in the
        living room, and I would perch on an ottoman in front of it while I exercised my low-resolution artistic
        talents. I guess I wore the TV out, because the red component of the picture would flake out after a while,
        leaving a greenish-blue tint.</p>

    <p>Ah, the good ol' days. I don't miss them at all.</p>
