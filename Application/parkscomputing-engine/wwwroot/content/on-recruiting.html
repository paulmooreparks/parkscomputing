    <h1>On Recruiting</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about this later, but I want to get this quote out there now so that technical leads, engineering managers, engineering directors, and vice-presidents of software engineering can have it embroidered on a pillow, printed on a t-shirt, and taped to their bathroom mirrors:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The quality of your company&#8217;s software will never exceed the quality of your company&#8217;s software developers. <br /> &#8212; Paul M. Parks</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re not recruiting the best developers you can possibly afford and training the ones you have, you&#8217;re losing to the companies that are.</p>
