    <h1>Parks Computing Services</h1>

    <p>I'm Paul Parks, a freelance software developer based in Singapore. If you'd like to know more about my skills and background, please take a look at <a href="/page/resume-of-paul-m-parks">my resume</a>.</p>

    <p>Below are some of my personal blog articles. Some are new, and some are from an earlier version of this site before I transferred it from WordPress to 
    my own bespoke engine. If you find the articles interesting, or if you'd like more information on a particular topic, 
    <a href="mailto:paul@parkscomputing.com?subject=Feedback">let me know</a>.</p>
