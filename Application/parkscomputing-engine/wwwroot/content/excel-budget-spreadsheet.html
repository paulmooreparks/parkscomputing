    <h1>Excel Budgeting Spreadsheet</h1>

    <p>
        My wife and I have been planning a move into a house on the western side of Singapore from our old condo in the
        east. Since it's a much bigger place, there is a lot of stuff to buy and various services to pay for in
        preparation for the move. To keep track of the expenses, I put together a budgeting spreadsheet that sort of
        took on a life of its own, and now I do all my bank account tracking and budgeting with it. Since it uses a couple of rather
        interesting formulas and techniques, I thought I'd post it here along with an explanation of how it works, in case it might be useful
        to someone else.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Register</h2>

    <p>
        The spreadsheet starts with a simple account register. Since this is an <a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/debits-and-credits" target="_blank">equity account</a>, 
        money going out of the account is tracked as a <a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/debit" target="_blank">debit</a>, and money coming into the account is tracked as a 
        <a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/credit" target="_blank">credit</a>. The "Net" column records a negative or positive amount, as required, and this value is summed 
        into the running balance.
    </p>

            sizes="(max-width: 1655px) 100vw, 828px, 546px" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        There is one feature of this that I still find a bit hokey, but I haven't come up with a simpler solution yet. The opening balance is placed in the 
        column header field for the "Balance" column.
