    <div class="timespan">August 2024 to present</div>
    <p class="duties">
        Xfer is an experimental data-serialization language that is designed to be a more flexible and more strictly typed alternative to JSON. 
        The GitHub repository contains a basic specification for the language along with a parser, an object model, and a serialization/deserialization utility.
    </p>

    <h3 class="position">Clic</h3>
    <div class="link"><a href="https://github.com/paulmooreparks/clic">https://github.com/paulmooreparks/clic</a></div>
    <div class="timespan">July 2024 to August 2024</div>
    <p class="duties">
        Clic began as a sample program to demonstrate and test the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) capabilities of the Cliffer CLI library.
        It is now a separate project that implements a stack-based calculator. The application stores the stack and variables across
        multiple invocations, making it suitable for scripting as well as interactive usage. Clic is implemented in .NET 8.0 and runs
        on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

    <p class="duties">
        Like Clic, ClifferBasic also began as a sample program for Cliffer. It is now a separate project that implements a BASIC programming
        environment as a command-line application, in the style of classic home computers like the Commodore 64 and the Apple ][. It is
        capable of editing, storing, loading, and executing BASIC programs, and it can execute BASIC commands interactively. ClifferBasic is
        implemented in .NET 8.0 and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

    <p class="duties">
        Cliffer is a .NET library built on top of Microsoft's System.CommandLine library that makes command-line interface (CLI) applications much easier
        to write. It uses attributed programming so that developers can add attribute declarations to their code, and the Cliffer library takes care of
        all the boilerplate necessary for creating complete, professional-quality CLI applications.

        My personal/freelancing web site was previously hosted on WordPress, but this was not sufficient for my needs and interests.
        I wanted to be able to edit raw HTML and try various web technologies on individual pages, which was difficult to do with WordPress.
        I wrote my own web site engine with ASP.NET Razor Pages on .NET 7. The site is hosted on Azure Web Services as a containerized application
        (Docker). I am currently adding the ability for readers to leave comments on pages. This feature is implemented as a RESTful web service
        hosted on Azure (containerized), with the comments stored in an Azure SQL Server database. I am extending the site engine to retrieve and
        display comments as well as accept new comments, and I am making a separate application to notify me of new comments so that I can approve
        or reject them.

    <p class="duties">
        The near-term goal is to implement a set of devices to bridge from the virtual CPU environment to the host machine,
        create a "BIOS" layer above the virtual devices, implement a simple OS and a subset of Unix/Linux system calls
        (interrupt $80), and finally port a C/C++ compiler (likely Clang or GCC) that will generate Maize machine code.
